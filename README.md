Please check out the video tutorials in the same folder as this folder for deployment and maintenance instructions for these programs.

Each of the below programs were made to enhance Vorne's capabilities utilizing its programming API.
They each are contained in a folder with the same name. It will have a text file "DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS" on how to deploy the programs out into production.
Each program may also have a "CONSTANTS" text file that will need to be modified on deployment.***ONLY EDIT INFORMATION ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COLON (:) SYBMOL, DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE AND KEEP ORDER THE SAME

Below are descriptions of each program with relevant information about them


------------
VorneAPITest
------------
The main control program that the user sets, starts, and stops the takt timer. It also controls the light system via serial communication through a USB port.


CONSTANTS

WORK CENTER: the work center number where the program will be deployed at
VORNE IP ADDRESS: the ip address of the vorne machine (model XL-810-1)
TAKT TIMER PORT: arbitrary port that the program will send information to its client programs (VorneAPITestC)
LIGHTS USB PORT: serial communication port where the lights arduino microcontroller is plugged into (will be in format "COM#")



-------------
VorneAPITestC
-------------
The typical operator program that exists on each operators computers, displaying the current takt time, production information, and also a scoreboard. It also has the ability to control the light system via serial communication through a USB port.

CONSTANTS

WORK CENTER: the work center number where the program will be deployed at
VORNE IP ADDRESS: the ip address of the vorne machine (model XL-810-1)
TAKT TIMER HOSTNAME: the host name of the master control program (VorneAPITest)
TAKT TIMER PORT: arbitrary port that the program will receive information from the master control program (VorneAPITest)
LIGHT PORT: serial communication port where the lights arduino microcontroller is plugged into (will be in format "COM#")


--------------
BarcodeScanner
--------------
A program that runs on the computer where serial labels are scanned out.
The program runs in the background listening for serial numbers entered from key presses or a barcode scanner.
Once a correct number is detected, it automatically tells vorne to +1 the good count. It will ignore serials that have already been scanned.

CONSTANTS

VORNE IP: the ip address of the vorne machine (model XL-810-1)
WORK CENTER: the work center number where the program will be deployed at



-----------
vorneLights
-----------
A program written for the arduino microcontroller that continuously receives input from the program "VorneAPITest" and relays that data to RGB lights connected to the arduino.
